KeeperFX Website Privacy Policy
===============================

**THIS IS A DRAFT, IT IS NOT APPLICABLE TO THE WEBSITE YET AND SHOULD BE IGNORED**



Privacy Policy

We take your privacy seriously at the KeeperFX website. This policy explains what personal data we collect from users of our website and how we use that data.

Data We Collect

We collect usernames and email addresses from registered users. Passwords are hashed and securely stored. We also collect IP addresses from both logged-in and non-logged-in users. IP addresses of non-logged-in users are anonymized and hashed to protect your privacy. 

Data Collection Methods

We collect data from user input, except for IP addresses which are collected automatically.

Data Use

To upload content, comment, and rate the content of others, users must register an account. This information is essential for the website to operate, and IP addresses are stored to prevent abuse.

Data Storage and Protection

We take security seriously. Passwords are hashed to protect them. The server administrator is the only one with access to non public data. Usernames and uploaded content are visible to the public.

Data Sharing

We do not share user data with third parties such as advertisers or analytics providers.

User Control

Users have control over their data. They can update their username, remove their email address, delete uploaded content, and contact us to remove all their data.

CDN and Reverse Proxy

The KeeperFX website uses Cloudflare as a content delivery network (CDN) and reverse proxy. This means that all website traffic is routed through Cloudflare's servers, which may result in the transfer of some of your personal information to Cloudflare. Although we have taken steps to minimize the amount of data that is shared with Cloudflare, there is still a theoretical risk that Cloudflare could access this data. Cloudflare's privacy policy states that they will only process user data on behalf of the website owner and will not use it for any other purpose. By using the KeeperFX website, you acknowledge and accept this risk.

Changes to the Privacy Policy

We'll notify users of any changes via email if an email address is provided. If any changes are made to this privacy policy, we'll publish a news article on the website.
