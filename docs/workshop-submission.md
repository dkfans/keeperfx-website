KeeperFX Workshop Submissions
=============================

**This is a draft**

- workshop items submitted by users will not automatically be accepted and will be put in a queue for scanning
- uploaded archives with passwords will be denied
- files will be automatically scanned on virustotal
- screenshots/thumbnails will be scanned using Google safeview (or w/e its called)
- name, description, etc will be scanned for bad words
- scans are not instant, we will poll VT and Google for results. When results come back the code decides on accepting or removal
- after a set amount of time, files will be re-analyzed (3 days = default)
- files submitted by users with a role of moderator or higher will be published before scanning is complete
