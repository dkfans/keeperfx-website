# Welcome to EmojiButtonList.js:

This is a JavaScript library that creates a small dropdown list of selectable Emojis.

To get started, download the source code and run the "index.html" file.  This will show three examples of how-to setup and use the class.

For further help with configuration, everything is documented in the unminimized "src/emojibuttonlistjs.js" JavaScript file.
