The **tail.writer** script is a neat, powerful, highly extend- and translatable Markup Editor,
written in Vanilla JavaScript. It currently supports the [GitHub Flavored] Markdown, BBCode and
Textile Markup languages.

### WYSIWYG vs. Markup
The tail.writer script is **not a WYSIWYG** (What you see is what you get) editor, it's a Markup
editor. The difference is the presentation of the written text: A WYSIWYG editor shows a bold text
directly as **bold text**, while a Markup editor shows only the Markup syntax: \*\*bold text\*\*.
(The shown syntax depends on the used Markup language, of course!)

However, you still have the possibility to add a Preview toolbar action to each single Markup
language. The Preview View is not editable and requires an additional JavaScript parser depending
on the used Markup language. We currently support the following libraries:

-   [GF] Markdown - [marked](https://github.com/markedjs/marked)
-   [GF] Markdown - [showdown](https://github.com/showdownjs/showdown)
-   Textile - [textile.js](https://github.com/borgar/textile-js)
-   BBCode - [tail.BBSolid](https://github.com/pytesNET/tail.BBSolid)

You can also use your own (or a not supported) parser library, of course. Check out the option
[`previewConverter`](https://github.com/pytesNET/tail.writer/wiki/Available-Options#previewconverter),
which allows you to pass your own parser callback function !

The Documentation has been moved to [GitHubs Wiki Pages](https://github.com/pytesNET/tail.writer/wiki),
but I will keep a table of contents list here and some basic instructions.

### Files
The **tail.writer** package contains many files and directories, which may confuse. The `less`
folder can be ignored, unless you want to write a completely own design using the icon set or
one of our designs as basic template. Basically the `css` and `js` folders (and the `markups` /
`langs` directories maybe too) contains the main files, which you need to embed on your website.
The content within the `css` folder should be self explanatory, the other ones contains these files:

-   `js/tail.writer(.min).js` - Contains the main script, WITHOUT any markup language.
-   `js/tail.writer-<markup>(.min).js` - Contains the main script, INCLUDING the named markup language.
-   `js/tail.writer-full(.min).js` - Contains the main script, INCLUDING ALL markup and interface languages.
-   `langs/tail.writer-all.js` - Contains all available interface languages.
-   `langs/tail.writer-<lang_code>.js` - Contains just the named interface language.
-   `markups/tail.markup-all.js` - Contains all available markup languages.
-   `markups/tail.markup-<markup>.js` - Contains just the named markup language.

In other words: No main action / button will be available if you just embed the `js/tail.writer(.min).js`
file. So either embed the desired markup language (within the `markups` directory) too or use a
direct bundle (or the full package).

### Basic Instructions
It's highly recommended to load the Stylesheet within your HTML Header, while you pass the
desired JavaScript files after the opened `<body>` tag (you can also include them before the
closing `</body>` tag, of course). Please make sure you load the Markup and Interface languages as
well as all plugins AFTER the main script. the `tail.writer()` function should be called within
the "DOMContentLoaded" event.

You can pass up to 2 arguments to the **tail.writer** constructor, the first parameter is required
and need to be an `Element`, a `NodeList`, a `HTMLCollection`, an `Array` with `Element` objects or
just a single selector as `String`, which calls the `.querySelectorAll()` method on its own.
The second parameter is optional and, if set, MUST be an `object` with your **tail.writer** options.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <meta charset="utf-8" />

        <link type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" href="css/tail.writer-white.min.css" />
    </head>
    <body>
        <script type="text/javascript" src="js/tail.writer-{markup}.min.js"></script>
        <!-- <script type="text/javascript" src="langs/tail.writer-{lang}.js"></script> -->

        <textarea></textarea>

        <script type="text/javascript">
            document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function(){
                tail.writer("textarea", { /* Your Options */ });
            });
        </script>
    </body>
</html>
```
